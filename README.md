# Inscription.tn
## Description
This project is my take on the [inscription.tn](inscription.tn) website. This idea was given as a Mentorini Summer Cup challenge 
This project is divided into 3 parts: Student, University and admin.
## Student (finished)
The students get redirected to their home page after logging in. They can modify their information, preview their soon-to-be college student card (Carte Etudiant) and pay their current University year (for example 2024-2025).
User-friendly and simple UI components present all of this.
## University (not finished)
The Universities are registered by the government. Each administration can view their registered students and manage the registration period.
## Admin (not finished)
The Admin can view every university, every registered student and some statistics. He/she can receive messages from students and uni administrators to answer their inquiries and consult yearly-updated statistics.
